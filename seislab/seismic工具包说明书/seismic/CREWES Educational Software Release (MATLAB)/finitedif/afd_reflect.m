function r=afd_reflect(velocity,clipn)
% AFD_REFLECT ... calculate the reflectivity from a velocity model
%
% r=afd_reflect(velocity,clipn)
% 
% AFD_REFLECT calculates the normal indicence reflectivity of an input
% velocity model for use with AFD_EXPLOAD.  
%
% velocity = velocity matrix
% clipn = the number of "bin layers" with which to remove from the
%       edge of velocity matrix in order to prevent artifacts from
%       the absorbing boundary conditions
%     = the suggested number is 5, but zero may also be chosen
% r = refelctivity calculated as .5*abs(gradient(log(velocity)))
