% [seismogram,seis,t]=afd_shotrec(dx,dtstep,dt,tmax,velocity,snap1,snap2,xrec,zrec,filt,phase,laplacian)
%
%
% AFD_SHOTREC will create a shot record given a velocity model and source 
% and receiver configutations. 
% Two input snapshots of the wavefield, one at time=0-dtstep and one at 
% time=0, are used in a finite difference algorithm to propogate the 
% wavefield.  The finite difference algorithm can be calculated with a 
% five or nine point approximation to the Laplacian operator.  The five 
% point approximation is faster, but the nine point results in a 
% broader bandwidth. Note that the velocity and grid spacing must 
% fulfill the equation max(velocity)*dtstep/dx < 0.7 for the model 
% to be stable.  The source array is included in the input 
% wavefield matrices, snap1 and snap2, and the receiver locations are defined
% by the user. Receiver arrays are not explicitely provided though they
% can be simulated after-the-fact by appropriate spatial convolutions.
% Of the two required snapshots, commonly they are either set equal to each other
% or the earlier one (snap1) is set to zero. These give different initial
% conditions. Two seismograms are returned:  one including all frequencies, and
% the other filtered by a gaussian function specified by the user.
%
% dx = the bin spacing for both horizontal and vertical (in consistent units)
% dtstep = size of time step for modelling (in seconds)
%         Stability requires max(velocity)*dtstep/dx < 0.7.
% dt = size of time sample rate for output seismogram. dt<dtstep causes resampling.
%		 dt>dtstep is not allowed. This allows the model to be oversampled for
%		 propagation but then conventiently resampled.
%		 The sign of dt controls the phase of the antialias resampling filter.
%		 dt>0 gives minimum phase, dt<0 is zero phase. Resampling is of course
%		 done at abs(dt). 
% tmax = the maximum time of the seismograms in seconds
% velocity = the input velocity matrix in consisnent units
%          must have the same size as snap1 and snap2
% snap1 = the wavefield at time=0 - dtstep (same size as velocity matrix)
%       This matrix determines the x and z sizes of the simulation. It should
%		be mostly zeros except for islotated ones corresponding to sources.
% snap2 = the wavefield at time = 0 (same size as velocity matrix)
%       This matrix represents the sources after one dtstep time step. Its often
%		acceptable to make this equal snap1.
% xrec = a vector of the x-positions of receivers (in consisent units)
%		The left hand column of snap1 is x=0.
% zrec = a vector of the z-positions of receivers (in consistent units)
%       The top row of snap1 is z=0. 
% filt or wlet = a 4 component ' Ormsby ' specification = [f1 f2 f3 f4] in Hz
%        or a wavelet. If it is longer than four elements, it is assumed to be
%      a wavelet. The wavelet should be sampled at the output sample rate
%      (dt)
% phase or tw ... If a the previous input was a four point filter, then this must
%     a scalar where 0 indicates a zero phase filter and 1 is a minimum phase
%     filter. If the previous input was a wavelet, then this is the time 
%     coordinate vector for the wavelet. The time sample rate of the wavelet MUST
%		equal dt.
% laplacian - an option between two approximation to the laplacian operator
%           - 1 is a 5 point approximation
%           STABILITY CONDITION: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(2)
%           - 2 is a nine point approximation
%           STABILITY CONDITION: max(velocity)*dtstep/dx MUST BE < sqrt(3/8)
