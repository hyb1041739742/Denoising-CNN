function drdt=drayvec(t,r)
% DRAYVEC: compute the derivative of ray vector (for vxz raytracing)
%
% drdt=drayvec(t,r)
%
% This is the fundamental driver for v(x,z) raytracing.
% The velocity model is defined by first calling rayvelmod.
% t ... scalar giveg the current time
% r ... 4x1 column vector giving (x,z,p,q)
% drdt ... 4x1 column vector giving the time-derivative of r
%
% By default, DRAYVEC uses nearest neighbor interpolation. Bilinear 
% interpolation is available for more accuracy. To get bilinear 
% interpolation, define a global variable called BILINEAR (all caps) 
% and set its value to 1. This is quite a bit slower than nearest 
% neighbor for the same grid size.
