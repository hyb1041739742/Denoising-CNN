function raymig(figno,pts)
% RAYMIG: raytrace migrate a picked event assuming normal incidence
%
% raymig(figno,pts)
%
% RAYMIG uses a velocity model initialized by RAYVELMOD and a
% vector of points picked using PLOTIMAGE. For each pair of points,
% a normal incidence ray is determined and projected down into the
% velocity model.
%
% figno ... figure number to plot the rays in
% pts ... n x 2 matrix of (x,t) vaues from PLOTIMAGE or equivalent
% ********** default is to use the global PICKS ***************
