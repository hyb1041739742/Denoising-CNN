% NORMRAYMIG: migrate a normal incidence ray
%
% [tr,r]=normraymig(x0,t0,dtdx,params,clr)
%
% NORMRAYMIG performs normal incidence raytrace migration for a velocity
% model that can vary with x and z. The model is built by defining a 
% matrix of velocity values and calling RAYVELMOD. SHOOTRAYVXY is called
% to trace the ray. If desired, then the ray may be plotted in any
% desired figure window.
%
% x0 ... surface x location of the ray measurement
% t0 ... the measured traveltime for the ray
% dtdx ... the measured time dip for the ray
% params(1) ... figure number for the ray to be plotted in
%    ********* default is no plotting *********
% params(2) ... time step size for raytracing (seconds)
%    ********* default = .004 seconds *********
% params(3) ... integer giving the number of grid increments
%		defining the width of the final dip bar on the plot.
%    ********* default = 4 ********
% PARAMS can be defaulted by providing nan for any entry.
% clr ... color to plot the rays with
%    ********* default = 'r' *************
% 
% tray ... vector of times from 0 to t0 sampled at params(2)
% r ... N by 4 matrix where N=length(tray). Each row is one time step. The
%	columns contain: r(:,1) x coordinate of the ray, r(:,2) z coordinate, 
%	r(:,3) horizontal slowness, r(:,4) vertical slowness.
