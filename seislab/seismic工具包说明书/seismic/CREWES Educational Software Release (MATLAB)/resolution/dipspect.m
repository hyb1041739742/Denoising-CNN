% dipspect(a,t,dx,f,vo,c,z)
%
% DIPSPECT makes a dip spectral analysis plot for v=vo+cz
% If z is not provided, then it is computed with 
% z=linspace(0,zmax,nz). Here, zmax is computed as the maximum
% depth for the supplied record length and nz=500. (If z is
% provided as a single number, then it is taken to be nz).
%
% a ... aperture
% t ... maximum recording time
% dx ... spatial sampling interval
% f ... frequency of interest
% vo ... initial velocity
% c ... accelerator ( v(z) = vo +c*z )
% z ... vector of depths for which limits are computed
% thrline ... color to plot the record length limit with
%    ********* default 'r' *********
% thapline ... color to plot the aperture limit with
%    ********** default 'c' ********
% thaline .... color to plot with alias limit with
%    ********* default 'g' ********
