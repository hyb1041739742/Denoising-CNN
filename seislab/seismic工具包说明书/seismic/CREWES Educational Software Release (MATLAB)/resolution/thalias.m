function theta = thalias(dx,f,vo,c,z)
% THALIAS: calculate aliasing versus depth for v(z)
%
% theta = thalias(dx,f,vo,c,z)
%
% Compute the zero offset scattering angle limit imposed
% by spatial aliasing
%
% dx ... spatial sampling interval
% f ... frequency of interest
% vo ... initial velocity
% c ... accelerator ( v(z) = vo +c*z )
% z ... vector of depths for which theta is computed
% theta ... vector of limiting scattering angles. One for each z.
