function drawline(action)
% DRAWLINE: draw a line on a figure window
%
% drawline(action,button)
%
% DRAWLINE is somewhat like SELBOX except that it draws a line rather
% than a rectangle. DRAWLINE uses the userdata of the current axes
% for storage and assumes that it initially contains [pt1x pt1y] the
% x and y coordinates of the starting point of the line. 
% So that DRAWLINE can be convieniently called several times in a row
% without outside intervention, DRAWLINE begins by deleting the graphics
% object whose handle is the fifth entry in the axes user data.
% An abort will occur if this user data entry is non-null with an
% invalid graphics handle.) After returning, the axes user data will
% contain the x,y coordinate of the 2 points defining the 
% rectangle and the graphics handle of the selection rectangle: 
% [p1x p1y p2x p2y handle]
%
% Several convienience functions make it easier to use DRAWLINE and
% you actually will rarely need to call DRAWLINE directly. DRAWLINEINIT
% should be called to begin the selection box process and DRAWLINEFINI
% to end it. You need do nothing else. DRAWLINEFINI, will return five
% values: [pt1x pt1y pt2x pt2y hline]
% Where pt1 and pt2 are the points defining the line and hline
% is the graphics handle to its on-screen image. (Note that 
% DRAWLINEFINI needs no arguments while DRAWLINEINIT has one optional
% argument described below)
% Example:
% [x,y,z]=peaks; % get something to plot
% pcolor(x,y,z); % plot it
% 
% drawlineinit % begin the line drawing
% % the line is drawn on screen
% vals=drawlinefini; % obtain the line coordinates
%
% Often you will want to do some action of your own upon a mouse button up
% event. This is easily done by passing a string argument to DRAWLINEINIT
% which contains any Matlab command (or series of commands).
% drawlineinit('do_my_thing')
%
% DRAWLINEINIT now takes a second argument which is the button number
% to be used in drawing the line. Drawing with any other button has
% no effect. Default is button 1.
