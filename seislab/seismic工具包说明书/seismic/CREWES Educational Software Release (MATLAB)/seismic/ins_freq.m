function ifreq = ins_freq(s,t,n)
% INS_FREQ Compute the instantaneous frequency useing complex trace theory
%
% ifreq=INS_FREQ(s,t)
%
% s ... real seismic trace (or matrix)
% t ... time coordinate vector for s (or time sample interval)
% n ... length of a boxcar smoother (in samples) to be convolved with the result
%  ************* default n=1 **********
% ifreq ... instantaneous frequency of the complex trace corresponding to s
