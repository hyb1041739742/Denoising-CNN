% SECTRESAMP resamples (in time) a seismic section.
% It simply loops over columns and calls resamp for each trace.
%
% seis ... input section of size nsamp x ntr. That is one trace per
%	column.
% t ... nsamp long time coordinate vector for seis
% dt2= desired output sample size (in seconds). May be any floating point 
%           number. 
%   timesout = start and end time desired for the output trace: [tmin tmax]
%  	If dt2 does not divide evenly into this interval then the first
%  	These times need not fall on the input time grid represented by t
%  	sample will be at tmin while the last will be just less than tmax
%         ********* default [t(1) t(length(t))] **************
%   flag= antialias filter option needed if dt2> t(2)-t(1) 
%         0 -> a zero phase antialias filter is used
%         1 -> a minimum phase antialias filter is used
%         ***************** default = 1 *****************
%   fparms= 2 element vector of antialias filter parameters
%         fparms(1)= 3db down point of high frequency rolloff
