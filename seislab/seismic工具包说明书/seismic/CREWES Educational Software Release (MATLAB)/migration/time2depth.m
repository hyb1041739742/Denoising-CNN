function [ztrc,z]=time2depth(trc,t,tzcurve,dz)
% TIME2DEPTH: Convert a trace from time to depth by a simple stretch
%
% [ztrc,z]=time2depth(trc,t,tzcurve,dz)
%
% TIME2DEPTH converts a single trace from time to depth. The conversion is
% specified by a time-depth curve that is stored in a two-column matrix.
% The first column is a list of times and the second is a list of 
% corresponding depths. The times can be either one-way or two-way and
% need only be consistent with the time-coordinate vector of the input.
% Between points in the time-depth curve, depths are interpolated linearly.
% Note that this function does not apply an antialias filter. It is
% up to the user to ensure that dz is sufficiently small to preclude
% aliasing.
% 
% trc ... the trace in time
% t ... time coordinate vector for trc
% tzcurve ... an n-by-2 matrix giving the time-depth curve.
%	n is the number of points on the curve and is arbitrary.
%	(more points is usually more accurate.) The first column is
%	time and the second column is the depths that correspond to
%	the times in the first column. The first time should be zero
%	and the last should be greater than or equal to max(t).
% dz ... depth sample size.
