function x = fftshiftc(x)% x= fftshiftc(x)%% This version of FFTSHIFT supplied in the Matlab toolbox is designed% to shift the columns of a large matrix, much as FFTSHIFTM does% but without the large memory requirements. The operation takes% place on each column, one at a time. For matricies of normal% size use FFTSHIFTM first, if memory problems develop, then try% this. For vectors, use FFTSHIFT or FFTSHIFTM.%% Correction by G.F.
