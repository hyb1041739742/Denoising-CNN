function prfilt=predict(trin,nop,nlag,stab)

% prfilt= predict(trin,nop,nlag,stab)
% prfilt= predict(trin,nop,nlag)
% prfilt= predict(trin,nop)
%
% PREDICT returns the nop long Wiener prediction filter for a  
% lag of nlag time samples. The filter is designed on the input
% trace, trin, and a stab factor is included by multiplying the 
% zero lag of the normalized autocorrelation by 1+stab.
%
% trin= input trace used to design the prediction operator
% nop= number of points in the prediction operator
% nlag= prediction lag distance in samples
% *********** default= 1 **************
% stab= stabilazation factor expressed as a fraction of the zero
%       lag of the autocorrelation.
%  ************ default= .0001 ***********
% prfilt= minimum phase Wiener prediction filter. Designed
%  such that:  prediction error= p.e.=> 
%      p.e.=trin(nlag:length(trin))-trinhat(1:length(trin)-nlag+1)
%  has minimum squared length and where:
%      trinhat= conv(trin,prfilt) is the predictable part of trin
