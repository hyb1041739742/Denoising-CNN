function c = convm(a, b)% c= convm(a,b)%% convm is a modification of the 'conv' routine from the MATLAB% toolbox. The changes make it more convenient for seismic purposes% in that the output vector, c, has a length equal to the first% input vector,  a. Thus, 'a' might correspond to a reflectivity% estimate to be convolved with a wavelet contained in 'b' to% produce a synthetic seismic response 'c'. It is assumed that% the wavelet in b is causal and that the first sample occurs at time zero.% For non-causal wavelets, use 'convz'. An abort will occur if% b is longer than a. CONVM will correctly handle an ensemble matrix.% %CONV	Convolution and polynomial multiplication.%	C = CONV(A, B) convolves vectors A and B.  The resulting%	vector is length LENGTH(A)%	If A and B are vectors of polynomial coefficients, convolving%	them is equivalent to multiplying the two polynomials.%	See also XCORR and DECONV and CONVZ%%	J.N.
