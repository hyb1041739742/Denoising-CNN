function trout=comb(trin,n,flag)%    trout=comb(trin,n,flag) %    trout=comb(trin,n)%% outputs a comb function which has unit spikes every n samples% % trin= input trace (to give dimensions)% n= interval between spikes in samples%    if n is negative, the spikes will alternatly be +1 and -1% flag= 0 ... first unit spike is at sample n/2 (*** default ***)% flag= 1 ... first unit spike is at sample 1% flag= 2 ... first unit spike is at sample n% trout= output comb function%% by G.F.
