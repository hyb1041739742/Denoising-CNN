function [wavelet,twave]=minwave(ampspec,f,stab)% [wavelet,twave]=minwave(ampspec,f,stab)% [wavelet,twave]=minwave(ampspec,f) %% Given an input amplitude spectrum, minwave computes the % corresponding minimum phase wavelet in the time domain.% ampspec= the input amplitude spectrum. Must be positive definite %           everywhere if stab is zero.% f= frequency coordinate vector% stab= stab factor. if stab is non-zero (and positive) then %       ampspec(f) is altered to ampspec(f)+stab*Max(ampspec)%       (default is zero)% SUGGESTION: create an appropriate f using fftrl. f must be% a frequency vector from 0 th Nyquist of length 1 greater than% a power of two. Ampspec must be the same length. % % by G.F.
