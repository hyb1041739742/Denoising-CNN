function [wzero,tw]=tozero(wavelet,twin)

% [wzero,tw]=tozero(wavelet,twin)
% wzero=tozero(wavelet)
%
% TOZERO uses FFT to capture the amplitude spectrum of an 
% arbitrary and outputs an 'all pass' equivalent.
%
% wavelet= input waveform to be converted
% twin= input time coordinate
% wzero= output all pass wavelet
% tw= output time coordinate. twin must be supplied for this
%     to be computed
%
% note: this result is never causal, use CONVZ to apply
% it (default time zero to length(winv)/2)
