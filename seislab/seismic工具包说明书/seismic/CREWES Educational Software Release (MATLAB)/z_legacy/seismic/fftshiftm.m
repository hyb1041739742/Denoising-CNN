function y = fftshiftm(x)% y= fftshiftm(x)%% This corrects the version of FFTSHIFT supplied in the Matlab toolbox% which is erroneous for matricies. For an input matrix [1 2;3 4],% FFTSHIFT returns [4 3;1 2] while FFTSHIFTM returns [3 4;1 2]%% Correction by G.F. Margrave, May 1991%%FFTSHIFTM Shift FFT.  For vectors FFTSHIFT(X) returns a vector with the%	left and right halves swapped.  For matrices, FFTSHIFT(X) swaps%	the first and third quadrants and the second and fourth quadrants.%	FFTSHIFT is useful for FFT processing, moving the zeroth lag to%	the center of the spectrum.%%	J.N.
