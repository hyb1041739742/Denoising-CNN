function winv=toinv(wavelet,stab,n)% winv= toinv(wavelet,stab,n)% winv= toinv(wavelet,stab)% winv=toinv(wavelet)%% TOINV uses match filtering to invert an arbitrary waveform.% For a band limited inverse, simply follow this by a filter. % A stab factor is supplied to avoid instabilities caused by % division by small numbers.%% Note: This inverse is always causal and should be applied% with CONV or CONVM. Sometimes a better, though % non-causal, inverse is obtained by TOINVF.%% wavelet= input waveform to be converted% stab= stab factor to be used expressed as a fraction of the%       peak of the amplitude spectrum %       **** default = .001 ****% n= length of inverse operator%    **** default = length(wavelet) ****% winv= output inverse wavelet%% by G.F.
