function newlineinit(transfer)% newlineinit(transfer)%% NEWLINEINIT initiates the creating of new lines in a figure window using% NEWLINE.  The sole argument, transfer, should be a MATLAB string with a% syntactically correct MATLAB command to be executed when a new line has% been created. For example if the function my_draw is calling newlineinit% to initiate drawing a line, then when NEWLINE finishes a line it would be% desirable to have it call my_draw with an appropriate argument such as the% string 'linedone'. This could be accomplished by:% newlineinit('my_draw(''line_done'')')%% The finished line and its graphic handle will be found in the userdata% of the current axes. Therefore it important that my_draw ensure there is% no important information stored there when newlineinit. To retrieve the% newline coordinates, my_draw must call newlinefini because some additional% cleanup must be done.  NEWLINE will terminate by calling my_draw everytime% it is signalled that a new line with a unique graphics handle has been% created. This occurs whenever:%	1) A new line has been drawn with mouse button 1 and terminated by%	   pressing button 2 or 3%	2) A new line has been created by duplicating an existing line%	3) A line has been deleted. In this case its handle is returned as%	   negative%	4) A deleted line has been restored with newline('undo')%% While NEWLINE has its own undo, it is often more convenient %% NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
