function editlinesinit(anchorinfo)% EDITLINESINIT is called to initiate editing with EDITLINES.% To use EDITLINES in a tool of your own crafting, it is usually necessary % to have the graphics handles of the lines to be edited if precise control% over the editing process is to be maintained. Suppose that there are three% (x,y) curves on display in the current axes of the current figure and let% their handles be hline1, hline2, and hline3 and let their coordinates be% given by vectors: x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3.  Then the following sequence% initiates  editing, terminates editing, and retrieves the edited (x,y)'s:%% editlinesinit; .... Begin editing. All three curves are available for%                     editing. Editing occurs for an indefinite period of time% editlinesfini; .... Terminate the editing session% x1=get(hline1,'xdata'); ... get line 1's x coodinates after editing% y1=get(hline1,'ydata'); ... get line 1's y coodinates after editing%% By supplying an argument to editlinesinit, you can control which curves% may be edited and if there are any initial anchor points on the curves.% (See anchor points below). (Note that editlinesinit with no argument means% everything is editable).  For example:%% editlinesinit([hline1 0 hline3 0]) ... line 2 may not be edited. Lines%                                        1&3 have no anchor points% editlinesinit([hline1 1 x1(10) y1(10) hline2 2 x2(5) y2(5) x2(15) ...%               y2(15) hline3 0])%	... this means all three lines may be edited. Line one has a single%	    anchor at the point x1(10) y1(10); line2 has 2 anchors at the%	    fifth and 15th points; while line 3 has no anchors.%% The argument to editlinesinit is called the anchor vector and gives% quite general control over editing. editlinesfini returns an updated% anchor vector in the same format as the input but with any changes which% the user has made. Thus it can be saved and supplied to editlinesinit to% resume editing in the same state. %% There are also several different modes that editlines can be run in.% Modes are activated at anytime in a editing session by an apporpriate % call to editlines:%% editlines('xonly') ... changes cannot be made to the y coordinates of %                        any point.% editlines('yonly') ... changes cannot be made to the x coordinates of %                        any point.% editlines('xandy') ... frees both x and y for changes% editlines('linkmode') ... toggles between link mode and normal mode% editlines('dragmode') ... toggles between constant drag and elastic drag% editlines('constantdrag') ... sets drag mode to constant% editlines('elasticdrag') ... sets drag mode to elastic%% Note that these calls are on-off toggles. That is if editing is already % in 'xonly' mode then: editlines('xonly') will free up the x coordinates % for editing.   Also, if both 'xonly' and 'yonly' are on then no changes % can be made.%% Lastly, editlines('undo') will undo changes made since the last mouse down.%% G.F.
