function a=integrate(u,x)% a=integrate(u,x)% a=integrate(u)%% INTEGRATE numerically integrates the vector u with respect to x.% That means that x must be a vector of the same length as u giving% the xcoordinates of u. If x is not supplied, one is generated as % x=1:length(u) which implies unit spacing between the elements of% u. For wavelengths large compared to the grid spacing, INTEGRATE% does an approximate job of undoing MATLAB's GRADIENT function to% within an additive constant. The method is essentially Simpson's% trapezoidal rule. See Numerical Recipies (2nd Ed.) eqn 4.1.11%%	example: %		x=0:2*pi/10:2*pi;%		y=cos(x);%		yp=gradient(y,x);%		yapprox=integrate(yp,x)+y(1);%		plot(x,[y;yp;yapprox]);%		rmserr=sqrt(sum((y-yapprox).^2)/(length(x)))%% G.F.
