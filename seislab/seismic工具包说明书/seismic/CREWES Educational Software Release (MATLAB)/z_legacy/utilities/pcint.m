function yi=pcint(x,y,xi)% yi=pcint(x,y,xi)%% pcint does piecewise constant interpolation.% That is, x and y are assumed to represent a function that is% "blocky" or piecewise constant. This means that for any xi% between x(k) and x(k+1), the function evaluates to y(k).% Points with xi < x(1) evaluate to y(1) and for xi>x(length(x))% evaluate to y(length(x))% NOTE xi must be sorted in ascending order. (xi(k)<xi(k+1))%% NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
