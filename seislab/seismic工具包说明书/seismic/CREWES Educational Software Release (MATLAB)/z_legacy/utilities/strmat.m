function smat=strmat(s1,s2)% smat=strmat(s1,s2)%% STRMAT can be used to form string matricies. It differs from MATLAB's% STR2MAT mainly in that it pads strings with 1's instead of blanks.% This makes detection of the pad easier when the string itself may% contain blanks. 1's are non-displaying ASCII characters.% If s1 is a string matrix (each separate string is a row) with n rows,% then smat will have n+1 rows and as many columns as the larger of% s1 & s2.% See also STRPAD STRUNPAD%% G.F.
