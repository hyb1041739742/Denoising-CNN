function waveletchangeinit(transfer,wavelet,tw,name,hfigmaster)% waveletchangeinit(transfer,wavelet,tw,name,hfigmaster)%% WAVELETCHANGEINIT begins the WAVELETCHANGE dialog which allow the interactive% alterations of a wavelet in any of the following ways:%	tomin ... convert to its minimum phase equivalent%	tozero ... convert to its zero phase equivalent%	toall ... convert to its all pass equivalent%	toinv ... invert the wavelet%   tr ... time reverse the wavelet%	window ... apply a temporal window%	phsrot ... apply an arbitrary constant phase rotation%	ghost ... include the effects of a near surface ghost%% The input parameters have the following meanings% transfer ... a MATLAB string with a syntactically correct MATLAB command%              which will transfer control to another program at the%              conclusion of the dialog% wavelet ... vector giving the wavelet amplitudes (time domain)% tw ... vector giving the time coordinates of the wavelet amplitudes% name ... name of the input wavelet% hfigmaster ... handle of a master figure in control of this one.%% NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
