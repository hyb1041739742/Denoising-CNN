function vout=mergenan(v1,v2,w1,w2)% vout=mergenan(v1,v2,w1,w2)%% MERGENAN forms the weighted sum of 2 matricies with special attention % paid to nan's. If both inputs are nan at any position, then the output% will also be; however, if only one is nan then the output will equal% the live matrix at that location. If both are live then the output is% the direct weighted sum. If v1 and v2 contain no nans, then the result % will be exactly ((w1.*v1)+(w2.*v2))./(w1+w2); % The weights can be simple scalars or they can be matricies of exactly% the same size as v1 and v2.%% G.F.
