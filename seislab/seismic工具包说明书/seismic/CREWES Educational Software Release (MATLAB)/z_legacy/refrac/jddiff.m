function X = jddiff(X,nd)%DIFF	Differentiate or difference.%	DIFF may be called numeric arguments.%%	For a numeric vector argument, DIFF computes differences.%	DIFF(X), for a vector X, is [X(2)-X(1)  X(3)-X(2) ... X(n)-X(n-1)].%	DIFF(X), for a matrix X, is the matrix of column differences,%	   [X(2:n,:) - X(1:n-1,:)].%	DIFF(X,nd) is the index seperation for the difference function.%	For example if nd=5, DIFF(X) is [X(6)-X(1)  X(7)-X(2) ... X(n)-X(n-5)].[m,n] = size(X);if m == 1   X = X(nd+1:n) - X(1:n-nd);else   X = X(nd+1:m,:) - X(1:m-nd,:);end
