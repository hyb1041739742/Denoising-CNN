function [xnot,ynot]=arclen2xy(x,y,a)% [xnot,ynot]=arclen2xy(x,y,a)%% Given a piecewise linear curve whose nodes are described by the vectors% x & y, ARCLEN2XY computes the (x,y) coordinates of the points whose% arclength (or inline distance) from (x(1),y(1)) is given by the vector a.% If the arclength is too large (or negative) then NaN is returned.%% G.F.
