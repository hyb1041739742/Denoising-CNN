function s=slope(x,y,xnot)% s=slope(x,y,xnot)%% compute the slope of the curve given by x,y at the point xnot. If the curve% is multivalued, then multiple s's will be returned. If the curve is a polygon, then% it must have its first and last points explicitly equal. The curve is assumed % piecewise linear. If xnot is exactly equal to a point in x, then the slope % returned is the average of the segments before and after xnot.%% NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
