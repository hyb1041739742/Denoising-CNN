function eqndefinit(transfer,hmasterfig,lognames,logdefaults,coefs,...		exps,newlogdes)% eqndefinit(transfer,hmasterfig,lognames,logdefaults,coefs,...%		exps,newlogdes)%% EQNDEFINIT is called by LOGEDIT to initiate a dialog  to define the% computation of a new log from existing ones via an algebraic equation.% The equation is of the form ((a*l1^k + b*l2^m)/(c*l3^n+d*l4^o))^p % Here l1,l2,l3,l4 are logs and the other terms are scalar constants. The% dialog allows the definition of the logs, the scalars, and the destination of% of the computed log.%% transfer ... transfer command to be called when the user terminates%		the dialog% hmasterfig ... handle of the masterfigure (usually a LOGEDIT window) in%		control of the dialog% lognames ... list of names of logs with individual names separated by '|' %		such as: 'fred|sam|billy|wilma'% logdefaults ... vector of length four containing four integers which are the % 		defaults for the four logs. These are taken to be row indicies into%		lognames% coefs ... vector of length four containing the defaults for a,b,c, and d% exps ... vector of length five containing the defaults for k,m,n,o, and p% newlogdes ... default descriptor for the new log. (Its "name" will%	be automatically implied by the mnemonic form its type.)%%% G.F.
