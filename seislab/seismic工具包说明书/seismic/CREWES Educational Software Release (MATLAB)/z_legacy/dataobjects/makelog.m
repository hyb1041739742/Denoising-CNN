function wellog=makelog(name,data,flag,metric,logtype)

% wellog=makelog(name,data,flag,metric)
%
% Make a random Earth Object containing a well log.
% The storage conventions used here are documented in logobj.txt
%
%	name =  string naming the log
%	data = m rows by 2 columns. First column is either the depth or
%		time coordinate of a log sample and the second column is
%		the actual log samples.
%	flag = 0 ... its in depth
%	       1 ... its in time
%	metric = 0 ... the log is in imperial units
%	metric = 1 the log is in metric units
%	logtype = integer flag giving the log type as documented in
%		LAS2LOGTYPE or logobj.txt
%		default is -1 (unknown log type)
