%
% OBJSET accepts an EarthObject (created by RANDOBJ, GRIDOBJ)
% and sets the values of one of it's items. If the
% item already exists, then its values are replaced; otherwise
% a new item is added to the object and its values inserted.
% New items are assumed to be data (as opposed to headers) and must be
% the same size and geometry as other data items already in the object. The
% identity of header fields in the object is fixed so new header information
% cannot be added; however, the existing headers can be changed (updated) at
% any point. A data item may be protected from accidental overwrite by setting its
% protect flag to 'on'. The first form of the command is used most often
% and sets items that are not specific to a particular dataset within the 
% object. Examples: (let myObj be an existing object)
%    myObj = objset(myObj, 'username', 'barney'); ... change the username to barney
%    yourObj = objset(myObj,'username','barney'); ... as above but create a new object
%    myObj = objset(myObj,' Leduc ',newGrid); ... a grid referred to by the matlab
%		variable "newGrid" is put in the object and named ' Leduc '
%    myObj = objset(myObj,'protect','on',' Leduc '); ... the ' Leduc ' grid is 
%		protected.
%    myObj = objset(myObj,'protect','off',' Leduc '); ... the ' Leduc ' grid is 
%		un-protected.
%    myObj = objset(myObj,'protect','on',3); ... the third grid is un-protected.
%
% objin = the variable name of the object to be updated
% item = a string specifying the item to be set (max of 30 characters)
% value = the value(s) of the item
% datanum = the sequential number of one of the data fields in the object
% dataname = string giving the name of one of the data fields in the object
%
% object = the output object. Normally this will be the same matrix as objin
