% Note: makehor is used by LOGSEC to write out a horizons file which can be
% taken into SEISLINE. The file name is hardwired to be: logsec_hor.dat
% Once this file is generated it is run through John Bornhurst's program
% er2slss.csh which generates 2 files for SEISLINE: xc.hor and 
% survey_summary.hor . Meanings of the variables are:
%	t ... matrix of times for horizons one per seismic trace.
%		One horizon per row. Times in milliseconds,
%		use -9999. to flag missing values.
%	utmx, utmy ... utm coordinates for the traces.
%	shotpt ... shotpoints
%	linename ... string containg the linename. Should be the same as
%		used in makeline2
