function val=fmget(fmat,action)
%
% val=fmget(fmat,action)
%
% FMGET is used to retrieve information from a flexi-matrix (see FMSET for a 
% definition. There are three possible values for action which result in three
% different return values:
%
% action = 'x' ... returns the x coordinates (positions of the columns) 
%                  of the matrix
% action = 'y' ... returns the y coordinates (positions of the rows) of 
%                  the matrix
% action = 'mat' ... returns the matrix
%
% Note that, due to the definition of a flexi-matrix, y values will be a 
% regular ordered set while the x values may be completely irregular 
% and in any order.  Also, the matrix will most likely contain a number of
% nan's in each column as these are used to pad the columns to equal length
