% OBJGRID creates an EarthObject designed to store earth science
% data sampled at regular grid locations. The matrix dimensions
% of 'data' define the grid while 'delx' and 'dely' specify the
% physical distance between columns and rows respectively. 
% The returned EarthObject, E, should NEVER be used directly in 
% computations because it is designed as a general data storage 
% object. Instead, use the appropriate OBJGET and OBJSET calls to 
% get and set the items in E.
%
% name = string vector specifying the object's name 
%					               requirement: length(name) <= length(data(:))
% data = matrix containing the gridded data
% dataname = string of ten chars or less giving the name of the data
%        ************ default = 'data' *************
% delx = physical distance between columns in the matrix
%        ************ default = 1.0 ****************
% dely = physical distance between rows in the matrix
%        ************ default = 1.0 ****************
% xnot = first column coordinate
%        ************ default = 0.0 ****************
% ynot = first row coordinate
%        ************ default = 0.0 ****************
