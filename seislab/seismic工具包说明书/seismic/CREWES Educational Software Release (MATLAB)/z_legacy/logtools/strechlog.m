function [trout,tout]=strechlog(trin,t,zonein,zoneout)% [trout,tout]=strechlog(trin,t,zonein,zoneout)%% STRECHLOG stretches a single time zone on a log into another. This done by% sinc function resampling with zero phase anti-alias filtering if needed.% trin = input trace or log (regularly sampled)% t= vertical coordinate vector for trin. Ostensibly time but could equally well be%		depth%  ************** trin and t must be the same length ************% zonein = time zone boundaries for the time zone to be streched. This should%		be a two element vector giving [tmin tmax]% zoneout = the input log, over the time zone zonein, will be streched to% 			fill this time zone at the same sample rate as input% The first output sample will be at zoneout(1)%% NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
