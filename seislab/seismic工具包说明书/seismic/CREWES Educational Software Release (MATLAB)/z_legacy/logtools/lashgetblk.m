function [block,ibeg,iend]=lashgetblk(lash,bname)% [block,ibeg,iend]=lashgetblk(lash,bname)% % LASHGETBLK interrogates a LAS header to find a logical data% 'block'. A block is defined as beginning with a line: % ~bname% where bname is a string, and ending at the beginning of the next % block or the EOF. Note that the block is considered matched if% the line in the LAS header matches ~bname up to the length of bname.% Thus a line in an LAS header like % ~logedit parameters% will match with bname of ~log, or ~logedit, etc... The returned block% is the first matching one. The match is not case sensitive.% lash ... LAS header in a string matrix% bname ... string containing the block name% block ... string matrix containing the block including the ~bname line.% ibeg ... the line number in lash of the beginning of the block% iend ... the line number in lash of the end of the block%% G.F.
