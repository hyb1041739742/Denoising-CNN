(Take % care that the existing densities are paired with the proper v's.) Densities% will only be computed with Garnders relation where they are missing and any% non-NaN input densities are simply passed to output.% 	v= vector of instantaneous p-wave velocities%	a= scalar multplier%		*********** default is .31 **********%	m= scalar exponent%		*********** default is .25 **********%	rho= on input, a vector of known densities which must be expanded with %		NaN's to be the same size as v%	rho= on output, aa vector of densities the same size as v and computed%		via Gardner's relation where densities were missing on input.%% G.F.
