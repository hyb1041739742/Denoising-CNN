function [w,tw]=wavemin(dt,fdom,tlength,m)
% WAVEMIN: creates a minimum phase w for impulsive sources
%
% [w,tw]=wavemin(dt,fdom,tlength,m)
% [w,tw]=wavemin(dt,fdom,tlength)
% [w,tw]=wavemin(dt,fdom) 
% [w,tw]=wavemin(dt) 
% 
% WAVEMIN returns a minimum phase w which simulates a 
% possible noise free impulsive source. Function uses TNTAMP and 
% LEVREC
%
% dt= desired temporal sample rate (seconds)
% fdom= dominant frequency in Hz
%  ******** default: 15 Hz *******
% tlength= w length in seconds 
%  ******** default: 127*dt (ie a power of 2) *******
% m = exponent controlling spectral shape. See tntamp for a description
% ************ default 2 ************
% 
% The w is generated from an analog expression for a nice
% amplitude spectrum. The corresponding autocorrelogram is 
% computed and input into LEVREC. The final w is the
% frequency domain inverse of the output from LEVREC.
