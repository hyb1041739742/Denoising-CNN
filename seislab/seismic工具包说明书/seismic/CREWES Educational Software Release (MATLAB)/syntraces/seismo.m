function [seismo,tlog,rcs,pm,p]=seismo(sonic,dens,z,fmult,fpress,wlet,tw)% [seismo,tlog,rcs,pm,p]=seismo(sonic,dens,z,fmult,fpress,wlet,tw)%% SEISMO computes a 1-D seismic model (seismogram) from well% log information. It uses the sonic log to build a time-depth% curve and then calls SEISMOGRAM. (See SEISMOGRAM help for more info)%% sonic ... vector of sonic log samples. Must be in typical sonic%	units (e.g. micro-sec/meter).% dens ... vector of same length as sonic giving density values.%	For a constant density result, provide this as ones(size(sonic)).% z ... vector of same size as sonic giving the depths of the log.% fmult ... multiple flag%            0 -> produce a primaries only convolutional seismogram%            1 -> produce a primaries (with attenuation losses) plus%                  multiples seismogram%   fpress ... flag for a pressure or displacement seismogram%            1 -> a pressure seismogram is desired%            2 -> a displacement seismogram is desired%          For a pressure seismogram, the source is a unit compression. For%          a displacement seismogram, the source is a unit displacement in%          the positive z (down) direction.%% wlet ... vector of wavelet samples%   Wavelets can be generated using any of WAVEMIN, WAVEZ, WAVEVIB,%   RICKER, and FILTF in the Seismic_Toolbox% tw ...  vector of time coordinates for the wavelet. Note that%         a non-causal wavelet should have tw(1)<0. The convolution%         will be such that the wavelet sample at tw==0 will be%         superimposed on the reflectivity spike%% seismo ... n length vector containing the seismogram samples.%         (n is determined by the algorithm).% tlog ... nlength vector containing the times for the seismogram%	rcs ... n length vector of computed reflection coefficients in time%  pm ... nlength vector of attenuated primaries plus multiples. %         If fmult == 0, this is identical to rcs.%	p ... nlength vector with attenuated primary rcs. If fmult==0, this%         is identical to rcs. If fmult==1, then the multiple content can%         be obtained as: pm-p%% G.F.
