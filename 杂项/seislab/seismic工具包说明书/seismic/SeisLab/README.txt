SeisLab

This folder contains a folder, S4M, with Matlab functions for seismic and 
well-log analysis, in the following collectively called SeisLab.

A manual in PDF format explains the philosophy behind design of the functions
in SeisLab and the way they can be used. For good measure, I have also added 
a few sample scripts (verba docent, exempla trahunt).

To run SeisLab functions, copy this folders to your computer and add 
the folder S4M and its subfolders to your Matlab path (please note that folders 
that start with "@" are class directories and need not be included 
explicitly in the Matlab path; Matlab will find them anyway; the same 
is true for "private" folders). I recommended that you run the 
sample scripts to ascertain that the installation was successful.

I do not promise any kind of support for these functions. 
However, should I happen to see a message in the Usenet newsgroup for Matlab 
(comp.soft-sys.matlab) that illustrates an obvious bug (not a "feature") or 
that tickles my fancy I might do something about it and post the result 
to the Matlab Program Exchange.

However, from time to time, I may upload updated or otherwise enhanced versions
of this software collection.
