function [t1,t2]=vint2t(vint,z,zout,tnot)
% VINT2T: compute time given interval velocity versus depth
%
% [t1,t2]=vint2t(vint,z,zout,tnot)
% [t1,t2]=vint2t(vint,z,zout);
% t1=vint2t(vint,z);
%
% Given interval velocity versus depth, compute 1 way vertical
% time as a function of depth.
%
% vint ... vector of interval velocities
% z ... vector of depths for each interval velocity.
%   Note: vint(k) is the velocity between z(k) and z(k+1). The
%   last v is used indefinitly as a half space
% zout ... vector of depths for which vertical travel times
%	are desired.
% ********* default = z ***************
% tnot ... constant time shift (seconds). (The time to z(1) )
%    Setting tnot=0 makes z(1) the reference datum
% ********** default = vint(1)/z(1) *********
%
% t1 ... vector of 1-way vertical times (seconds) corresponding to zout
% t2 ... vector of 1-way vertical times (seconds) corresponding to z
% Note: if zout was not the same as z, then you may wish to 
% compute a set of velocities to match. Use vint2vrms or vint2vave
% depending on which type of interval velocities you want.
