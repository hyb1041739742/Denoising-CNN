function [trc,t]=depth2time(ztrc,z,tzcurve,dt)
% DEPTH2TIME: Convert a trace from depth to time by a simple stretch
%
% [trc,z]=depth2time(ztrc,z,tzcurve,dt)
%
% DEPTH2TIME converts a single trace from depth to time. The conversion is
% specified by a time-depth curve that is stored in a two-column matrix.
% The first column is a list of times and the second is a list of 
% corresponding depths. The times can be either one-way or two-way and
% need only be consistent with the time-coordinate vector of the input.
% Between points in the time-depth curve, times are interpolated linearly.
% Note that this function does not apply an antialias filter. It is
% up to the user to ensure that dz is sufficiently small to preclude
% aliasing.
% 
% ztrc ... the trace in depth
% z ... depth coordinate vector for ztrc
% tzcurve ... an n-by-2 matrix giving the time-depth curve.
%	n is the number of points on the curve and is arbitrary.
%	(more points is usually more accurate.) The first column is
%	time and the second column is the depths that correspond to
%	the times in the first column. The first depth should be zero
%	and the last should be greater than or equal to max(z).
% dt ... time sample size.
