function imp=rcs2impbl(rcs,t,fmin,fmax,delflow,delfhigh)% imp=rcs2impbl(rcs,t,fmin,fmax,delflow,delfhigh)%% RCS2IMPBL takes a reflectivity vector specified in time and computes% a corresponding impedence by integrating and exponentiating it.% The integration is bandlimited (done by BLINT) so as not to generate% significant power outside the band [fmin fmax]. The resultant impedance% estimate is returned with mean removed.%% rcs... column vector of reflection coeficients% t  ... column vector of times (note that rcs must be regularly sampled)% znot ... initial impedance (at t=t(1)) estimate% fmin ... minimum frequency to pass% fmax ... maximum frequency to pass% delflow ... gaussian rolloff width on low end%         ******* default min([5 flow/5]) *******% delfhigh ... gaussian rolloff width on high end%         ******* default min([(fnyquist-fhigh)/10 10]) *******%% G.F.
