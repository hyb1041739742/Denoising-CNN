function imp=blimp(trin,implog,t,flow,fhigh,delf)% imp=blimp(trin,implog,t,flow,fhigh,delf)%% BLIMP estimates acoustic impedence from a seismic trace% using a well log to provide the low frequency component.% The algorithm is described in Ferguson and Margrave (1996 CREWES% annual report).  This used to be called SEISINV2. Blimp is an % acronym for band limited impedance. %	% trin ... input seismic trace% implog ... input impedance log (in time)% t ... time coordinate vector for trin% flow ... lowest frequency in trin to keep% fhigh ... highest signal frequency in trin% delf ... width of Gaussian rolloff filter to be applied to%	log at flow and trin at flow+delf%	****** default min([5 flow/5]) *******%% G.F.
