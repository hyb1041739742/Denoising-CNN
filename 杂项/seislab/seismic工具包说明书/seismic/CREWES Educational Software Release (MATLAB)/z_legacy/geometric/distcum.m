function s=distcum(x,y)% s=distcum(x,y)% s=distcum(x)%% If the first form is used, x and y represent the 2-D coordinates of a set of% points. If the second form is used, x represents an incremental distance % vector computed from the point coordinates by distinc. The return value, s,% is the cumulative distance for the set of points. That is, s(j) represents% the distance measured along the point set from the jth point to the first% point.% See also distpoint and distreach%% x = vector containing the incremental distances as computed by distinc%% s = cumulative distance vector containing the distance between each point%      and the first point. %     Note: length(s) == length(x). s(1) == 0, s(2) == ( distance from%     point 2 to point 1), s(j) = ( distance from point j to point 1 )%% by G.F.
