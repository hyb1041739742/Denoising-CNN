function ynot=ycurve(x,y,xnot)% ynot=ycurve(x,y,xnot)%% compute the y coordinates of the curve given by x,y at the point xnot.% If the curve is multivalued, then multiple y's will be returned. If the% curve is a polygon, then it must have its first and last points explicitly% equal. If xnot lies outside the bounds and the curve is not a polygon,% then the curve is extrapolated by repeating the% first or last sample as% needed. If it is outside the bounds and the curve is a polygon, then []% is returned.%% by G.F.
