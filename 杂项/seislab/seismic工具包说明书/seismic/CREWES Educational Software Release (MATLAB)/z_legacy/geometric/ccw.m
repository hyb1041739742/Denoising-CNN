function flag = ccw(pt1,pt2,pt3)% flag = ccw(pt1,pt2,pt3)%% CCW is an implementation of Sedgewick's algorithm (Algorithm's in C++,% Robert Sedgewick, 1992, Addison-Wesley, p350) for determining the sense of% rotation when traveling from pt1 to pt2 to pt3 (these are points in the% x,y plane). If this travel results in rotation through a counter clockwise% angle then +1 is returned which -1 is returned for a clockwise angle. A% special case is when the three points are colinear. In this case, if pt1% is between pts 2&3 then -1 is returned, if pt2 is between pts 1&3 then +1% is returned, and if pt3 is between pts 1&2 then 0 is returned. % % Note that each point is a 2 element vector giving x first then y.%% G.F.
