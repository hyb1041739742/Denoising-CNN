function [s,indicies]=distreach(x,y,xnot,ynot,r)% [s,indicies]=distreach(x,y,xnot,ynot,r)%% This function searches the point set represented by x,y to find those points% which lie within a radius r of the single point xnot,ynot. The distances of% the found points are returned in s and their indicies in indicies. Thus, the% number of found points is length(s) and they are identified as:% x(indicies),y(indicies) is the set of points whose distances from xnot,ynot% are given by s <= r.% See also distcum distinc and distpoint%% x = vector containing the x coordinates of the data points%% y = vector containing the y coordinates of the data points%% xnot = scalar x coordinate of the single point%% ynot = scalar y coordinate of the single point%% r= radius of the search region (also called the reach)%% s = distance vector containing the distance between each point in%     x and y and the point xnot,ynot%% by G.F.
