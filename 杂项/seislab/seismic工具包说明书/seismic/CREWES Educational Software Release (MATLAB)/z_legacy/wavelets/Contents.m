% The CREWES Project Synthetics Toolbox
% 
% A collection of tools for building synthetic seismic traces and sections.
% Also contains numerous wavelet functions and an interactive wavelet editor.
%
% Synthetics: wavelets and reflectivity creation
% einar    --- create a constant Q impulse response according to Kjartanssen theory
% minwave  --- compute a minimum phase wavelet given its amplitude spectrum
% ormsby   --- create and ormsby (filter) wavelet
% reflec   --- generate a synthetic pseudo-random reflectivity
% ricker   --- generate a Ricker wavelet
% rnoise   --- generate a random noise vector with a specific s/n
% sweep    --- generate a linear synthetic Vibroseis sweep
% tntamp   --- return an amplitude spectrum characteristic of an 
%              impulsive source
% wavedyn  --- substandard minimum phase wavelet
% wavemin  --- nice minimum phase wavelet
% wavenorm --- normalize a wavelet
% wavevib  --- generate a vibroseis (Klauder) wavelet
% wavez    --- generate a zero phase wavelet with specific dominant frequency
% wavez2   --- generate a zero phase wavelet with specific passband
% waterbtm --- compute the impulse response of a zero offset water bottom multiple
