function askthingsinit(transfer,q,a,flags,titlestr,ttstr)% Please use "askthingsle" if developing new programs%% askthingsinit(transfer,q,a,flags,titlestr)% askthingsinit(transfer,q,a,flags)% askthingsinit(transfer,q,a)% askthingsinit(transfer,q)% ASKTHINGSINIT initiates a dialog which allows the user to answer any% number of questions which can be answered with strings or popup menu% selections.  No attempt is made to determine the legitmacy of the answers,% that is up to the master program. The simplest form, which does not supply% 'a', results in a dialog which displays each question in a static text% uicontrol and places an edit text along side for the answer to be typed% in. If a is supplied, then it must have the same number of rows as q. To get% the same behavior as just described for any particular question, leave its% row blank. To cause a popup menu to appear in place of the edit text field,% put a string in the corresponding row of a which will be the label string of% the popup. That is, if you wish question 3 to only have the possible answers% Fred or Bill or Sam, then code the third row of a as 'Fred|Bill|Sam'. The% popup will always appear with the first % string as the default answer.  In% its simplest mode, the dialog will not dismiss until either all questions% have a string answer or the user pushes the cancel button. (No check is made% on popups since the user may be accepting the default.) This behavior can be% modified by suppliying the flags matrix. Flags must have one entry for each% question.  % as q. The entry is a boolean flag that is the answer to "Must% this question be answered?" That is, if it is all ones then all questions% are required to have answers. A zero for any question means it is% optional. For popups, this flag is the index of the default choice in the% list of alternatives.% % transfer = a string matlab command to be evaluated with EVAL at the%            completion of the dialog. Usually this will re-invoke the%            calling program%        q = a matrix of strings containing questions which the user%            must answer. One question per row, any number of questions%        a = a matrix of strings supplying alternatives for the possible%            answers. If a is supplied, it must have the same number of%            rows as q. If a row of a is blank then an edit text is supplied%            to receive the answer. Otherwise the row should contain the%            label string for a popup menu with the "|" symbol separating%            alternatives%	     **** default is a matrix of blanks ****%    flags = one entry for each question. If a question is to be answered %            with an edit text then flag is a boolean for that question. %            If 1 then the dialog will not dismiss until the question%            is answered. If 0, the question is optional. %            If the dialog is to be answered with a popupmenu, then flag%            indicates the default setting of the menu. If flag is 5, then%            the fifth choice will be shown in the popup and will be%            selected if no action is taken.  Note that any entry for flag is%            valid for edit text questions but, for popups, entries outside%            of 1->n (n being the number of alternate choices) will result%            in errors.%	     **** default is all ones ****% titlestr = title string for the dialog. %            **** default: 'Please supply this information:' ****%% See ASKTHINGS for more info on how to use the dialog% See ASKTHINGSFINI for a description of how to terminate the dialog%% G.F.
