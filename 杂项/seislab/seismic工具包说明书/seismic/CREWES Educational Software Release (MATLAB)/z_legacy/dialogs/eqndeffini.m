function [lognums,coefs,exps,type,des]=eqndeffini

% [lognums,coefs,exps,type,des]=eqndeffini
%
% Call this to complete the Log algebra equation definition dialog. 
% Return values mean:
%  lognums = vector of length four giving the numbers of the four logs
%  coefs = vector of length four giving the scalar coeficients of the four logs
%  exps = vector of length five giving the scalar exponents of the four 
%         logs and the overall exponent
% type = type flag for the new log
% des = string descriptor for the new log
