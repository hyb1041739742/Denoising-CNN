function [tops,ztops]=readtops(filename)

% [tops,ztops]=readtops(filename)
%
% Read in tops information from a standard ascii file. The file is
% defined as one with an arbitrary number of header lines containing any
% information followed by two columns of formation top name and depth.
% The header lines must begin with two slashes (//)
% but are otherwise arbitrary and are ignored by this function. 
% The top names may be arbitrary character strings (including embedded
% whitespace) while the top depths are taken to be the first numerical value
% surrounded by while space. 
%
% Example tops file:
%
% // this is a comment
% top bun     1392.3
% ketchup     1512.0
% mustard     1512.0
% relish      1565.0
% burger 1    1572.0
% burger 2    1682.0
% bottom bun  1.792e3
