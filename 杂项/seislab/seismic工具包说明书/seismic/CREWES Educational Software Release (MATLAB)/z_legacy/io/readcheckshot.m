function [zcs,tcs]=readcheckshot(filename)% [zcs,tcs]=readcheckshot(filename)%% Read in checkshot information from a standar ascii file. The file is% defined as one with an arbitrary number of header lines containing any% information followed by two columns of numbers: the first being depth% and the second time. The header lines must begin with two slashes (//)% but are otherwise arbitrary and are ignored by this function. The times% may be one-way or two-way since CSCORRDISP is designed to handle both.% Time will be output in seconds. If the time in the file contain any values% greater than 10.0, they are assumed to be milliseconds and converted.%% G.F.
