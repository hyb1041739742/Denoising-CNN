function writelas(fullfilename,lasheader,logmat,z)

% writelas(fullfilename,lasheader,logmat,z)
% writelas(fullfilename,lasheader,logmat)
%
% WRITELAS writes and LAS (Log ASCII Standard) dataset to disk.
%
% fullfilename ... a string containing the fully qualified filename
% lasheader ... a string matrix containing as las header which
%		matches the data in z and logmat. Two easy ways to get this
%		are 1) from READLAS or 2) from MAKELASHEADER
% logmat ... matrix of logs, one per column. Note that since LAS
%	does not support NaN's, all NaNs in the logmatrix must be set
%	to a NULL value consistent with that in the LAS header.
% z ... vector of depths
%
% NOTE: if Z is not supplied then it is assumed that the first column
%  of logmat containes the depths. If z is supplied, the it is
%  prepended to logmat as column 1.
%
% NOTE: number of rows in logmat must be the same as the length
% of z
