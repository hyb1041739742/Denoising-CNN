function simplezoom(arg,arg2)% simplezoom(button,transfer)%% Installs simple zooming action on the current figure. To% Zoom any 2-D axes, simply make sure the axes parent figure is% current and type: simplezoom% at the matlab prompt to install the zooming function. Then simply% draw a rectangle by clicking and dragging the mouse. The axis will% 'zoom' at the completion of the draw. To unzoom, enter a rectangle% of zero size which is done by a simple mouse click without any % motion.% button ... refers to the mouse button to be used to draw%		the zoom box. Any other button will cause no action.%  ********* Button default is 1 ***********% Transfer ... is a string containing any legal matlab command% 		which is to be called at the completion of the zoom. %		This is key to using SIMPLEZOOM in a larger program so that%		control can be returned to the larger program following%		the zoom.% ********** Default is '' ************%% G.F.
