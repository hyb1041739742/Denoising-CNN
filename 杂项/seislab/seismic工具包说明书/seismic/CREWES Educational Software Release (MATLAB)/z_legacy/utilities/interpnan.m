function y0=internan(x,y,x0)% y0=interpnan(x,y,x0)%% INTERP is similar to MATLAB's INTERP1 unless x contains nans.% If nans are present, then they are assumed to mark distinct segments% of x which are handled independently. Each such segment must obey the% usual restrictions imposed by interp1 (i.e. monotonic) but there need% be no relation between the segments.% If x contains no nans, there is still a difference between this and% interp1. The latter will bomb if any x0 lie outside the range of x.% This routine will not bomb and returns nans instead. Note that the% actual interpolator used is lint not interp1 because lint is more % efficient when length(x0) >> length(x) .%% G.F.
