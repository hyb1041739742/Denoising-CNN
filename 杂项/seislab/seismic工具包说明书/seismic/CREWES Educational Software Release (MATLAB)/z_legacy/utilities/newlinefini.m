function lineinfo=newlinefini%% lineinfo=newlinefini% % NEWLINEFINI is called to obtain the handle and (x,y)'s of a line created% by NEWLINE and to perform needed cleanup. The returned information% consists of the handle of the new line, a vector of x coordinates and a% vector of y coordinates. Note that the number of points on the new line is% not provided but is simply: n=(length(lineinfo)-1)/2%% lineinfo=[key handle x1 x2 x3 .... xn y1 y2 y3 .... yn]%% The key gives needed information about the new line as follows:% key = 1 ... the line was created by drawing with the puck% key = 2 ... the line was created by duplicating an existing line% key = 3 ... the line was created by undoing a line deletion% key = 4 ... the line was actually deleted. Its handle is no longer valid.%% When a line is deleted, the lineinfo return value has all of the above% information plus additionaly info encoding the deleted lines color,% linestyle, etc. The is appended to the above information using a NaN as% a separator. Thus if key==4, then :%   ind=find(isnan(lineinfo));%	info = lineinfo(1:ind-1);% will store in info the simple lineinformation vector given above. The% simplest way to restore a deleted line with its color etc intact is to call:% newline('undo',lineinfo,transfer);% where lineinfo is the complete return value from NEWLINEFINI and transfer% is a string indicatining where the NEWLINE should return to when completed% (see NEWLINEINIT)%% NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
