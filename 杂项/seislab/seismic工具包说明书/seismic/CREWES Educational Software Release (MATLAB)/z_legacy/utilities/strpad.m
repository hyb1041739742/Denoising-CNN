function s3=strpad(s1,s2)

% s3=strpad(s1,s2)
%
% STRPAD will pad string s1 to the length of s2 with 1's. Since 1's
% are non-displaying ASCII characters, this is easy to remove later
% and can be distinguished from intentional blanks in the string.
% If s2 is a scalar, then it is taken to be the pad length for s1.
