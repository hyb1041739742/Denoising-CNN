function indtraj=ind2traj(irow,icol,nrows)%% indtraj=ind2traj(irow,icol,nrows)%% IND2TRAJ converts a set of row and column indicies to a set% equivalent 1-D indicies which evaluate the matrix along the% trajectory specified by the row/column indicies. Given irow% as a vector and icol as a vector, direct evaluation of a % A as: B=A(irow,icol), will result in B as a matrix which% has dimensions length(irow) by length(icol). However, there% is an alternate interpretation of irow and icol as a set of% index pairs which specify a trajectory through A. In this% case, we would like to write something like: B=A(indtraj)% and have B result as a vector which is the matrix A sliced% along the trajectory. This routine does jsut that.%%	irow ... vector of row indicies of the trajectory%	icol ... vector of column indicies of the trajectory%	nrows ... number of rows of the matrix to be sliced%	indtraj ... index of the trajectory%% example: A=magic(3);%	indtraj=ind2traj(1:3,1:3,3);%	A(indtraj) % returns the main diagonal of A%% G.F.
