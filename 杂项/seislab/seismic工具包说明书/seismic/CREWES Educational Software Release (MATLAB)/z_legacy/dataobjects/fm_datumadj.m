%
% FM_DATUMADJ performs datum adjustment on a fleximat.
% The traces in the input fleximat are looped over, stripped of
% nans on the beginning and end, datum shifted by the shift for
% the particular column, and stored in the output fleximat. 
% Note that shifts are rounded to the nearest sample to avoid
% costly resampling of each trace. The datum shift is accomplished
% by removing the old datum and installing the new one. The
% installation of a datum is done
% by subtracting the y coordinate of the datum at the column 
% x coordinate from the column y coordinates.
% Datum removal is the opposite of datum installation.
%
% Default for the old datum is all zeros
