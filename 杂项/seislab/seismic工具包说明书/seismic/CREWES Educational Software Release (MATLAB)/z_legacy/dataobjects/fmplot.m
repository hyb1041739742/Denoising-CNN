% fact=fmplot(fmat,vaflag,fact,flipy,kolor,hax)
%
% FMPLOT does a quick plot of a flexi-mat in a figure window (made by fmplot). 
% It plots the columns as wiggle traces centered at their x coordinates.
%
%	fmat ... the flexi-mat to be plotted
%	vaflag ... if 0, then traces are plotted at wt (wiggle traces) 
%		if 1, then the traces are plotted wtva
%      if 2 the rev. pol. wtva
%		************* default = 1 *********
%	fact ... scaling factors. Make fact(1) bigger for bigger wiggle
%		traces. fact(2) controls the overall plot scale. If not
%		provided, it is computed as max(abs(matrix)). To scale two
%		fmplots the same, capture the return value from the first and
%		provide is as fact(2) for the second
%		************* default 1.5 ***********
%	flipy ... if 1, then the y axis is reverse so that it goes from top
%		of window to the bottom
%	   ************* default 1 ***********
%  kolor ... color to plot the traces
%     ************* default = [1 0 0] (red) ************
%  hax ... handle of the axis to plot the fleximat in. If -1, then a new figure
%          is created.
%     ************* default = -1 **************
%Note: To scale two fmplots with respect to the maximum absolute value
% on the first plot, capture the return value from the first
% and provide it as the third argument for the second plot:
%	fact=fmplot(fmat1);
%	fmplot(fmat2,1,fact);
