% OBJRAND creates an EarthObject designed to store 
% earth science data sampled at arbitrary (x,y) locations. 
% The returned matrix, E, should NEVER be used directly in 
% computations because it is designed as a general data storage 
% object. Instead, use the appropriate OBJGET and OBJSET calls to 
% get and set the items in E.
%
% name = string vector specifying the object's name 
%	    requirement: length(name) <= length(data)
% data = vector containing the data
% x = vector containing the x coordinates of the data
%				 ******* default= no field set *********
% y = vector containing the y coordinates of the data
%				 ******* default= no field set *********
% datatype = string vector specifying the data type
%                    requirement: length(datatype) == 4 
%     ******* default = '    ' *********
