% well=makewell(name,location,wellog)
%
% Make a earthobject representing a well with name, location, and 
% (optionally) a log
%
% name = string giving the well name
% location = 3 or 4 element vector giving: [x y elevation inline_distance]
% wellog = random Earth Object containing the log. If the log is in depth 
%          then it should have two data fields: 'depth' & 'samples' and 
%          be of datatype 'zlog', else it should have data fields 
%          'time' and 'samples' and be of type 'tlog'
