function [mask,htrin]=hmask(trin,thresh)

% [mask,htrin]=hmask(trin,thresh)
% [mask,htrin]=hmask(trin)
%
% Compute the Hilbert Reflectivity Mask of trin.
% HMASK returns a trace which is zero everywhere except at the
% samples corresponding to peaks of abs(hilbert(trin)) where it
% is 1.0
%
% trin= input trace
% mask= output hilbert mask trace
% htrin= complex hilbert transform of trin. (e.g. hilbert(trin))
% thresh = threshold significance for peaks. Peaks on the Hilbert
%	envelope are ignored if they are smaller than thresh times
%	the maximum peak.
