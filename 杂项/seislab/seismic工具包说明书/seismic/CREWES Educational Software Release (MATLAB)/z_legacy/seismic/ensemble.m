function [x,tx,a,ta,w,tw]=ensemble(ntraces,nsamps,dt,fdom)% [x,tx,a,ta,w,tw]=ensemble(ntraces,nsamps)%% ENSEMBLE generates an ensemble (profile) of synthetic traces% for use with ensemble averaging experiments%% ntraces= number of rows in the matricies x and a% nsamps= number of columns in x, keep this a power of 2!! % dt= time sample rate desired on output% fdom= dominant frequency of the waveform % x= an ntraces by nsamps matrix of gaussian random noise where%    each row has been convolved with the waveform w.% tx= time coordinate vector for x% a= the two-sided autocorrelation matrix of x, ntraces by 2*nsamps%    (There is an extra sample added to keep things a power of two)% ta= time coordinate vector for a% w= minimum phase waveform with a dominant frequency of fdom% tw= time coordinate vector for w%% by G.F.
