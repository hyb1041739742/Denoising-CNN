function q=sprat(A1,A2,f,t1,t2,fsmo)% q=sprat(A1,A2,f,t1,t2,fsmo)%% SPRAT applies the spectral ratio method to estimate an apparent% interval attenuation factor, q, between the traces (wavelets) % whose amplitude spectra are A1 and A2. Both spectra must be the% same length, one sided, and described by the frequency vector f.% Spectra are smoothed prior to ratioing with a boxcar of length% fsmo. The log spectral ratio is plotted and the user enters a box% with the mouse (as in the manner of a zoom with PLT) which % determines the frequency range for the least squares fit. The % best fit straight line is then determined and plotted and the% apparent q is shown.%  A1 ... amplitude spectrum at time t1%  A2 ... amplitude spectrum at time t2%  f ... frequency vector for A1 and A2%  t1 ... time for spectrum A1%  t2 ... time for spectrum A2%  fsmo ... length (Hz) of a frequency smoother%% by G.F.
