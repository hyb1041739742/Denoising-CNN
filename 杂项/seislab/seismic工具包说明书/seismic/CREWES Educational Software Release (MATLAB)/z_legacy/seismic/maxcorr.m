function x=maxcorr(trace1,trace2,n)% x=maxcorr(trace1,trace2,n)%% MAXCORR computes 2*n+1 lags of the crosscorrelation of trace1% with trace2 (using CCORR) and then uses splines to pick the% maximum to the nearest .1 lag. The interpolated maximum and % lag are returned as x(1) and x(2)%% trace1= input trace number 1% trace2= input trace number 2% n= 2*n +1 lags will be computed% x= output: x(1)-> interpolated maximum cross correlation%            x(2)-> interpolated lag at maximum correlation% % Note: a negative result for x(2) indicates trace2 is delayed%       relative to trace 1%% by G.F.
