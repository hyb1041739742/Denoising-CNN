function [trout,x]= deconpr(trin,trdsign,nop,nlag,stab)% [trout,x]= deconpr(trin,trdsign,nop,nlag,stab)% [trout,x]= deconpr(trin,trdsign,nop,nlag)%% DECONPR performs Wiener predictive deconvolution by calling% PREDICT to design a prediction filter, nop long with lag nlag% and stab factor, using trdsign. The predicted part of trin, trinhat,   % then formed by convolving the prediction operator with trin,% and trout is computed by delaying trinhat by nlag samples and % subtracting it from trin. The prediction operator is returned% in x.%% trin= input trace to be deconvolved% trdsign= input trace used to design the prediction operator% nop= number of points in the prediction operator% nlag= prediction lag distance in samples% stab= stabilazation factor expressed as a fraction of the zero%       lag of the autocorrelation.%  ************ default= .0001 ***********%% trout= deconvolved output trace% x= prediction operator%% See also: Peacock and Treitel, Geophysics vol 34, 1968%  and the description of PREDICT%% by G.F.
