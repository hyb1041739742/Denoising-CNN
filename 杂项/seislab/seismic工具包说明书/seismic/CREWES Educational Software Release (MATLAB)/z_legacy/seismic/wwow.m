function [wavelet,tw,pseudo]=wwow(trin,t,tleng)% [wavelet,tw]=wwow(trin,t,tleng)%% WWOW performs the 'wwow' method of wavelet extraction which% is identical to a single channel BOOT. The final wavelet is % determined via a time domain match filter.%% trin= input trace% t= time coordinate for input trace% tleng= maximum length of output wavelet% wavelet= output wavelet% tw= time coordinate for wavelet%% by G.F.
