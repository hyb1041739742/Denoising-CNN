function trout=calfil(trin,t,aec_length,flow,fhigh,nfilt)% trout=calfil(trin,t,aec_length,flow,fhigh,nfilt)% % CALFIL emulates Chevron's time variant spectral whitening % program of the same name. A set of gaussian filters are% designed to slice a frequency range in such a way that the% linear sum of slices returns the original spectrum. Each slice% is then ifft'd into the time domain and aec'd. Finally, the % slices are summed in the time domain.%% trin= input trace % t= time coordinate vector for trin% aec_length= length (seconds) of the aec operator% flow= lowest frequency to be whitened (Hz)% fhigh= highest frequency to be whitened (Hz)% nfilt= number of Gaussian filter slices% trout= output trace%% by G.F.
