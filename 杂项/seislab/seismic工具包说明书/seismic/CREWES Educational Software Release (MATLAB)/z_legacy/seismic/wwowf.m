function [wavelet,tw,pseudo]=wwowf(trin,t,fsmoth,flag)% [wavelet,tw]=wwowf(trin,t,fsmoth,flag)%% WWOWF performs the 'wwow' method of wavelet extraction which% is identical to a single channel BOOT. The final wavelet is % estimated by a frequency domain match filter%% trin= input trace% t= time coordinate for input trace% fsmoth= length of frequency smoother in Hz.% flag=0 ... smooth the filter spectrum prior to inverse transform%     =1 ... smooth the spectra of trin and trdsign before division%     =2 ... both 0 and 2   %  ********* default= 0 ********  % wavelet= output wavelet% tw= time coordinate for wavelet%% by G.F.
