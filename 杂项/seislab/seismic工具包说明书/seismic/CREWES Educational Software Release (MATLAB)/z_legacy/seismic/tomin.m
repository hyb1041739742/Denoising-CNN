function wavemin=tomin(wavelet,stab)% wavemin= tomin(wavelet,stab)% wavemin= tomin(wavelet)%% TOMIN uses the Levinson algorithm to convert an arbitrary% waveform to its minimum phase equivalent.%% wavelet= input waveform to be converted% stab= stab factor to be used expressed as a fraction of the%       zero lag of the aurocorellogram%   *********** default = .0001 ************% wavemin= output minimum phase equivalent of wavelet%% The wavelet is autocorrelated and input to LEVREC.% The output minimum phase wavelet is the frequency domain % inverse of the output from LEVREC.% % by G.F.
