function a = auto2(v,flag)% a=auto2(v,flag)% a=auto2(v)%% auto computes the two sided autocorrelation of % the vector 'v'. The 'zeroth lag' is at length(v)-1. This % routine will correctly handle an ensemble matrix.% % v= input vector% flag= 1.0 ... normalize the 'zero lag' (first returned value)%               to 1.0.%        anything else ... don't normalize%       ******* default =1.0 ******%% NOTE: A two sided autocorrelation or a cross correlation can be%       computed with XCORR in the signal toolbox.%%   by G.F.
