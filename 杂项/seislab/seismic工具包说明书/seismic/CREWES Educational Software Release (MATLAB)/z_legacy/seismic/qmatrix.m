function qmat=qmatrix(q,t,w,tw)% qmat=qmatrix(q,t,w,tw)%% Generates a matrix which applies a forward q filter. The qmatrix is% also bandlimited by a stationary "source signature" waveform.%% q ... value of Q% t ... vector of times to generate q response at% w ... stationary source waveform% tw ... time vector for w% qmat ... length(t) by length(t) matrix which applies a forward Q%		filter.% 		If r is a column vector of reflection coefficients, then%		s=qmat*r; is a simple synthetic seismogram with attenuation.%% G.F.
