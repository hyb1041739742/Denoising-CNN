function [mfilt,tm]=match(trin,trdsign,t,mlength,flag)% [mfilt,tm]=match(trin,trdsign,t,mlength,flag)%% MATCH designs a match filter of temporal length 'mlength'% which matches trin to trdsign in the least squares sense.% That is sum_of_sqs(conv(mfilt,trin)-trdsign)==minimum%% trin= input trace to be matched to trdsign% trdsign= input trace which is to be matched% t= time coordinate vector for trin% ***** note: trin and trdsign must be the same length% mlength= length of the match filter in seconds% flag=0 ... a noncausal operator is desired%     =1 ... a causal operator is desired% NOTE: Suppose that 'a' is a known time series and 'w' is also%  a known wavelet. Then let bm=convm(a,w) and bz=convz(a,w).%  Then [westm,tw]=match(a,bm,ta,length(w),1) or%       [westz,tw]=match(a,bz,ta,length(w),0) %  will both produce good estimates of w. %  However, %       [westx,tw]=match(a,bz,ta,length(w),1) %  should not be used%  but%       [westy,tw]=match(a,bm,ta,2*length(w),0)%  will produce a valid estimate of w in the second half of westy.         %% mfilt= output mlength match filter% tm= time coordinate for the match filter%% by G.F.
