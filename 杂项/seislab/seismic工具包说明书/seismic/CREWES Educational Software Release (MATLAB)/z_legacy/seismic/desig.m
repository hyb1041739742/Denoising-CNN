function trout=desig(trin,wavelet,stab,flag)%% trout= desig(trin,wavelet,stab,flag)% trout= desig(trin,wavelet,stab)% trout= desig(trin,wavelet)%% DESIG uses frequency domain methods to deconvolve a wavelet out% of trin. A stab factor is added to the spectrum of wavelet which % is then inverted over its entire frequency band (except for a % zero phase high frequency rolloff). The spectrum of trin is % then multiplied by this operator spectrum and inverse transformed.% A sufficient zero pad is automatically added to trin.%% trin= input trace to be de-signatured% wavelet= input waveform (the known signatur)% stab= stab factor to be used expressed as a fraction of the%       peak of the amplitude spectrum.  %   *********** default = .001 ************% Alternate: If stab > 1, it is interpreted as being expressed%   in dbdown. Thus stab=80 is equivalent to stab=.0001% flag= 0 ... wavelet is not causal%     = 1 ... wavelet is causal% ************ default=1 ***********%% trout= output desig'd trace.%% by G.F.
