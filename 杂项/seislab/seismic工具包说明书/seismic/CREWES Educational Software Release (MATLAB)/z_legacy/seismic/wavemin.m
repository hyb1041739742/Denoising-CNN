function [wavelet,twave]=wavemin(dt,fdom,tlength)
% WAVEMIN: creates a minimum phase wavelet for impulsive sources
%
% [wavelet,twave]=wavemin(dt,fdom,tlength)
% [wavelet,twave]=wavemin(dt,fdom) 
% [wavelet,twave]=wavemin(dt) 
% 
% WAVEMIN returns a minimum phase wavelet which simulates a 
% possible noise free impulsive source. Function uses TNTAMP and 
% LEVREC
%
% dt= desired temporal sample rate
% fdom= dominant frequency in Hz (default: 15 Hz)
% tlength= wavelet length in seconds (default: 127*dt 
%                                     (ie a power of 2))
% 
% The wavelet is generated from an analog expression for a nice
% amplitude spectrum. The corresponding autocorrelogram is 
% computed and input into LEVREC. The final wavelet is the
% frequency domain inverse of the output from LEVREC.
