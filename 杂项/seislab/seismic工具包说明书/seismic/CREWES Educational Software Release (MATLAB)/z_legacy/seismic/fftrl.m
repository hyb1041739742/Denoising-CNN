function [spec,f]= fftrl(s,t,percent,n)

% Forward fourier transform of a real trace. This is done in brute
% force fashion to mimic the result of Vern Herbert's real to
% complex FFT. A penalty of a factor of two is paid. Relative to
% MATLAB's fft it returns only the positive frequencies in an array
% half the size. If the input trace is a vector, then the return
% is simply the transform of that trace. If a matrix, then each 
% column of the matrix is transformed.
%
% s= input trace (or gather) 
% t= input time coordinate vector
% percent= specifies the length of a raised coisine taper to be
%          applied to s prior to any padding. Taper is a percent
%          of the length of s. Taper is applied using "mwindow"
%          from the seismic toolbox. Default=0%
% n= length to which the input trace is to be padded with zeros.
%  
% spec= output spectrum
% f= output frequency sample vector
