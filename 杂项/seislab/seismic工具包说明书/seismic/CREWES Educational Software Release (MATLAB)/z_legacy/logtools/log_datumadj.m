function ylogout=log_datumadj(ylog,xlog,xd,yd,xdold,ydold)% ylogout=log_datumadj(ylog,xlog,xd,yd,xdold,ydold)% ylogout=log_datumadj(ylog,xlog,xd,yd)%% LOG_DATUMADJ performs datum adjustment on a log's vertical coordinates.% The datum shift is accomplished% by removing the old datum and installing the new one. The% installation of a datum is done% by subtracting the y coordinate of the datum at the logs x coordinate% from the log's y coordinate vector.% Datum removal is the opposite of datum installation.% Datum shifts are rounded to the nearest whole sample (sample rate is %	taken to be ylog(2)-ylog(1) )%% ylog ... vector of y (vertical) coordinates for log% xlog ... scalar giving the logs x coordinate% (xd,yd) ... piecewise linear specification of the new datum% (xdold,ydold) ... piecewise linear specification of the old%		datum%% Default for the old datum is all zeros% % NOTE: It is illegal for you to use this software for a purpose other% than non-profit education or research UNLESS you are employed by a CREWES% Project sponsor.
