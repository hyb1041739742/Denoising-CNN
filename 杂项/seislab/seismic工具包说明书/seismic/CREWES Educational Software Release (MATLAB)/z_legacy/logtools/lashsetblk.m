function lashout=lashsetblk(lash,bname,block)% lashout=lashsetblk(lash,bname,block)%% LASHSETBLK is the opposite side of the coin to LASHGETBLK. It searches% an LAS header to find a logical data block named bname and replaces% it with the string matrix called block. (If isempty(bname) then a deletion% will occur. If the block does not already exist in the header then it% it is inserted just before the ~A block (which begins the log traces). The% ~A line MUST be the last line in the header or the header is invalid.% lash ... string matrix containing the input las header% bname ... string containing the block name% block ... string matrix containing the block to be set (inserted)%% G.F.
