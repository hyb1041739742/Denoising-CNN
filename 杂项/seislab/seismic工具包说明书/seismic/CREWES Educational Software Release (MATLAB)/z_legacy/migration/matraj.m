function traj=matraj(amat,ksamps)% traj=matraj(amat,ksamps)%% MATRAJ evaluates a matrix along a columnwise trajectory.% That is, ksamps contains one entry per column of amat giving% a desired sample number. Traj is a row vector, one entry% per column of amat, containing those samples desired.% If ksamps contains the entry 0, then zero will be returned% in traj. No checking is done to ensure ksamps points to% values between 1 and nrows. This must be done externally. %% G.F.
