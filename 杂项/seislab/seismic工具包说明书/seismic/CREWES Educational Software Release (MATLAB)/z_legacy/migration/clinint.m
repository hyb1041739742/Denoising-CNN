function vint = clinint(f,v,fint)% vint = clinint(f,v,fint)%% CLININT does complex linear interpolation of a function assumed to the% the t->f transform of a time domain function defined from 0 to some tmax.% In order to avoid spectral artifacts, the interpolation weights are % complex (i.e. have phase terms). These weights may be derived by % considering sinc function interpolation, which in the time domain is% boxcar multiplication, and shifting the boxcar into the time range% of 0->tmax.%% f    ... vector of frequency coordinates. Must be regularly sampled and%	   in increasing order.% v    ... vector of complex spectral values% fint ... vector of interpolation frequencies. All fint must lie between%	   f(1) and f(length(f).% vint ... vector of complex spectral values interpolated linearly at the% 	   frequencies fint.%% G.F. Margrave and J.
