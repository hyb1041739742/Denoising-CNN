function L=sphdiv(v,z,p)
% SPHDIV: for a v(z) medium, compute the geometrical spreading factor
%
% L=sphdiv(v,z,p)
%
% SPHDIV shoots a single ray or fan of rays through a stratified 
% velocity model and calculates their geometrical spreading factors.
% It is assumed that v is a vector of interval velocities and that
% the ray goes from z(1) to z(length(z)). This routine does no error
% checking for efficiency. Be sure that v and z are both the same
% length. It returns inf if a critical refration occurs. 
%
% v... COLUMN vector of interval velocities
% z... COLUMN vector of depths to the tops of the intervals
% NOTE: v and z must be at least length 2 or an abort will occur
% p... scalar or ROW vector ray parameters
%
% L ... scalar or ROW vector spreading factors
