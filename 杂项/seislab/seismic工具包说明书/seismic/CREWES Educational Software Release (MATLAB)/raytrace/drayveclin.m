function drdt=drayveclin(t,r)
% DRAYVECLIN: compute the derivative of ray vector for v0=a*x+b*z
%
% drdt=drayveclin(t,r)
%
% This is the fundamental driver for v(x,z) raytracing.
% The velocity model is defined by first calling rayvelmod.
% t ... scalar giveg the current time
% r ... 4x1 column vector giving (x,z,p,q)
% drdt ... 4x1 column vector giving the time-derivative of r
