function h=drawpick(x0,t0,dtdx,dx,figno,col,lw)
% DRAWPICK: draw a line on top of an image (e.g. seismic)
%
% drawpick(x0,t0,dtdx,figno,dx,col,lw)
%
% This function makes it easy to draw a "pick" on top of a seismic
% image. The pick is defined by three numbers (x0,t0,dtdx) that give
% the center of the pick and the timedip. The pick is drawn with the
% specified timedip centered at (x0,t0).
%
% (x0,t0) ... position of the center of the line
% dtdx ... timedip of the line
%	******** default 0 ********
% dx ... horizontal dimension of the line
%	******** default width-of-axes/20 *******
% figno ... figure number to draw in
%       ******** default gcf ********
% col ... color to draw with
%	******** default 'r' *******
% lw ... line thickness to draw with
%	******** lw = 2 **********
%
% h ... handle of the drawn line
