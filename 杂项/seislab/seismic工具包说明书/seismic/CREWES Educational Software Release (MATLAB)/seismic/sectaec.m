% SECTAEC runs automatic gain correction on a seismic matrix.
%
% sectin ... input section of size nsamp x ntr. That is one trace per
%	column.
% t ... nsamp long time coordinate vector for sectin
% op_length= half-length of triangular smoother in seconds
% trip= front end time before which the smoothed envelope is
%        set to a constant ******** default= op_length/10 ******
% sectout ... output section of size nsamp x ntr.
