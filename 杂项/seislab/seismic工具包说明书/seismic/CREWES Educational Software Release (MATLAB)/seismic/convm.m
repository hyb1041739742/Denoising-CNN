function s = convm(r,w)
% CONVM: convolution followed by truncation for min phase filters
%
% s= convm(r,w)
%
% convm is a modification of the 'conv' routine from the MATLAB
% toolbox. The changes make it more convenient for seismic purposes
% in that the output vector, s, has a length equal to the first
% input vector,  r. Thus, 'r' might correspond to a reflectivity
% estimate to be convolved with a wavelet contained in 'w' to
% produce a synthetic seismic response 's'. It is assumed that
% the wavelet in w is causal and that the first sample occurs at time zero.
% For non-causal wavelets, use 'convz'. An abort will occur if
% w is longer than r. CONVM will correctly handle an ensemble matrix.
