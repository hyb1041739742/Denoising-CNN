function theta = thaper(a,vo,c,z)
% THAPER: compute aperture-limited scattering angle versus depth
%
% theta = thaper(a,vo,c,z)
%
% Compute the zero offset scattering angle limit imposed
% by recording aperture.
%
% a ... aperture
% vo ... initial velocity
% c ... accelerator ( v(z) = vo +c*z )
% z ... vector of depths for which theta is computed
% theta ... vector of limiting scattering angles. One for each z.
